How to connect create a Python Virtual Environment


It is often useful to have one or more Python environments where you can experiment with different combinations of packages without affecting
your main installation. Python supports this through virtual environments. The virtual environment is a copy of an existing version of Python
with the option to inherit existing packages. A virtual environment is also useful when you need to work on a shared system and do not have 
permission to install packages as you will be able to install them in the virtual environment
